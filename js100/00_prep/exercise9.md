Which of the following names don't satisfy the style guidelines for
naming variables, functions, or constants?

| Name           |
| -------------- |
| `index`        |
| `CatName`      |
| `snake_case`   |
| `lazyDog`      |
| `quick_Fox`    |
| `1stCharacter` |
| `operand2`     |
| `BIG_NUMBER`   |

### Answer:
`snake_case`, `quick_Fox`, `1stCharacter`

LS explanation:

Underscores are permitted in constant names, but these aren't
constant names since they use lowercase letters. `1stCharacter` isn't
valid at all: names may not begin with a digit.
