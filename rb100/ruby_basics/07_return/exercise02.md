## Breakfast, Lunch, or Dinner? (Part 2)
What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted to answer

```ruby
def meal
  'Evening'
end

puts meal
```

It will print 'Evening'. This is similar to the previous exercise, the only
difference is that this does not explicitly use the `return` keyword. But as we
know, methods return the evaluated result, or the return value, of the last line
that is executed.
