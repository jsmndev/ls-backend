# Confucius Says
# You want to have a small script delivering motivational quotes, but with the 
# following code you run into a very common error message: no implicit 
# conversion of nil into String (TypeError). What is the problem and how can 
# you fix it?

def get_quote(person)
  if person == 'Yoda'
    'Do. Or do not. There is no try.'
  end

  if person == 'Confucius'
    'I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand.'
  end

  if person == 'Einstein'
    'Do not worry about your difficulties in Mathematics. I can assure you mine are still greater.'
  end
end

puts 'Confucius says:'
puts '"' + get_quote('Confucius') + '"'

# This is happening because there is no explicit return value for each if
# statement. It always ends up on evaluating the last if statement. So if
# we pass in 'Einstein', we would get the quote from Einstein. But since
# we pass in a string != Einstein, the last if statement always evaluates
# to nil, therefore get_quote('Confucius') returns nil and concatentating
# nil with `String#+` won't work bec that method expects a string.
# We can fix it by explicitly putting the return keyword for every quote or
# use a case statement/ if else statement so that the code of execution
# would only run for the expected quote to return
